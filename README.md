Oh goodness, just walked out of The Ugly Stepsister and my head's still spinning like, like...you ever see seagulls fight over a soggy french fry? Yeah, like that. Anyway, I’m here with this itchy popcorn crumb in my sweater and everything. Just chaos, absolute chaos. The  , not the crumb — though maybe both. 

It's loud. So loud. My ears feel like how cheese might feel getting grated. The theater was packed, couldn't hear half the dialogue over people laughing, or crying? Hard to tell sometimes. That scene though... the one with the pumpkin AND the raccoon?? How did they even come up with—no wait, that was not even important but hilarious! Some random guy next to me said they reminded him of his neighbors. I didn't ask, but he whispered the whole plot twice over.

>Oh, and the colors! Wild, vivid madness, they smacked you right in the eyeballs. Purple? So much purple. If I ever see lavender again it'll be too soon. After that part where she trips over the frog and lands in the... I'm not sure what it was? Fountain, I think? Her laugh was like those squeaky toys dogs like, not annoying but strangely comforting. Quite different from those usual sappy fairy tales. Felt more like a hoagie you couldn't fit into your mouth properly, dripping with, with... erm, adventure sauce?

I remembered you said to 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the   but honestly, nothing beats 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨 the   with such a massive, collective human mess. You can almost taste the excitement, or maybe that's just the Mountain Dew residue on my fingers. Either way, pretty sure you'll love the thing where she throws the biscotti out the window - such symbolism, or... or just breakfast indeed flying away. Someone bring me a chiropractor because jeez, these seats are medieval torture devices!

The plot was... a bit like if my cat tried to write a novel. So don’t expect a conclusion to everything. Loose ends like a yarn ball party. But hey, aren't we all a bit like that?
